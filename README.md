# Freedump (free as in beer üç∫)

Freedump is a library and cli tool that allow you to read/write/dump the memory of a process via Frida, and also to manipulate a dump
later locally for quick search.

Right now, it has been tested only for Linux/Android but I guess it should be trivial to add the support for Windows/OSX.

Freedump is composed of some tricks to speed up the access via Frida of the memory, and to have a unify library for researcher (as it is a common case).

On some case, like to dump the entire process memory range on Android, it will reduce the time to wait, from 1/2 minutes to few seconds (no benchmark sorry, just trust me).
